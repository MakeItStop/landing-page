Make It Stop!
=============

A task based alarm app built using <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript">Nativescript</a> for people who find it hard to wake up in the morning. To stop the alarm, the user must complete a task, answer a question or complete a mini game. This app was a two week project in our final 10th and 11th weeks of the [MakersAcademy](https://github.com/makersacademy) bootcamp.
